------------------------------------------------FILE INFO------------------------------------------------
map5.pgm and map5.yaml: Our attempt to try gmapping, not very good results. These files are obsolete.

deneme7.world: Our testing environment for project

mapformat.txt: Description of how a map file should be written
robotankMAP.txt: Manually created map file for our environment (deneme7.world)

robot_design.png: Picture of Turtlebot modified by Boran
hexagons.urdf: This file needs to be placed to "opt/ros/kinetic/share/turtlebot_description/urdf/stacks/" and simulation must be started in an empty world

src: Contains all source code
src/Code_References: Contains information about which parts of the code belongs to Robotank team and which parts are taken



------------------------------------------------INSTRUCTIONS------------------------------------------------
1) Put src folder inside catkin workspace

2) Put robotankMAP.txt folder inside catkin workspace (unfortunately, filename of map and patrol locations are not configurable from outside, a little code modification needed)

3) Put hexagons.urdf.xacro into folder opt/ros/kinetic/share/turtlebot_description/urdf/stacks/

4) Start the simulation by
roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot_world.launch world_file:=<path to deneme7.world>

5) Start each node
rosrun motion_detector motion_detector_node 
rosrun turner turner_node
rosrun patroller patroller_node 

6) Watch the simulation until robot lose its position and crashes into a wall, then go to step 4
